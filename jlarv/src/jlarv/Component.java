  Abstract class for every component, every one of them should extend it.

  It's utility is to keep the code more organized.
  Also allows for type checking when debugging.
	
  A component is just a ton of data, almost always with just a constructor
  that sets up some variables.
  Can also have some methods like getters and setters to modify
  and/or access the data, but can't have any logic around it.
  Logic is 100% done by the Systems.
